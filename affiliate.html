Neocrym participates in the following affiliate links programs:

<h3></h3>Amazon Associates</h3>
Neocrym Records Inc is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by linking to Amazon.com. As an Amazon Associate, Neocrym Records Inc may earn money from qualifying purchases made by users that were directed to Amazon.com via one of our affiliate links.

These affiliate links are only visible on web properties. Amazon Associates forbids sending affiliate links over email. As such, when Neocrym publishes a new post on Substack, the post's webpage may have affiliate links to Amazon, but Substack converts these links to non-affiliate Amazon links when sending posts over email.
