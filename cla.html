    Intellectual property law can be complicated, and we do not want to end up
    in a situation where our own repositories contain IP that we do not have the
    rights to use or distribute. In order to make things clear, we ask all open
    source contributors to sign this CLA.<br /><br />When you open your first
    pull request against one of Neocrym's projects on GitHub, the
    <a href="https://cla-assistant.io">CLA Assistant</a> bot will reply asking
    you to sign the below CLA.<br /><br />Neocrym's CLA is adapted from the
    <a href="https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-corporate"
      >Google Individual Contributor License Agreement</a
    >.

<p>
  In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with
  Contributions from any person or entity, Neocrym Records Inc. ("Neocrym") must
  have a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") on file that has been signed by
  each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This
  license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of
  Neocrym; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any
  other purpose.
</p>
<p>
  You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present
  and future Contributions submitted to Neocrym. Except for the license granted
  herein to Neocrym and recipients of software distributed by Neocrym, You
  reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Definitions</strong>. "You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright
    owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this
    Agreement with Neocrym. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution
    and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
    control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the
    purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or
    indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by
    contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of
    the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.<br />"Contribution"
    shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or
    additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to
    Neocrym for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or
    managed by Neocrym (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition,
    "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication
    sent to Neocrym or its representatives, including but not limited to
    communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and
    issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Neocrym for the
    purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication
    that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as
    "Not a Contribution."
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Grant of Copyright License</strong>. Subject to the terms and
    conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Neocrym and to recipients
    of software distributed by Neocrym a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
    no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare
    derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and
    distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Grant of Patent License</strong>. Subject to the terms and
    conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Neocrym and to recipients
    of software distributed by Neocrym a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
    no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section)
    patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and
    otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent
    claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your
    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the
    Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes
    patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim
    or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work
    to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent
    infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this
    Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such
    litigation is filed.
  </li>
  <li>
    You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above license. If
    your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that
    includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission
    to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has
    waived such rights for your Contributions to Neocrym, or that your employer
    has executed a separate Corporate CLA with Neocrym.
  </li>
  <li>
    You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see
    section 7 for submissions on behalf of others). You represent that Your
    Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license
    or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and
    trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with
    any part of Your Contributions.
  </li>
  <li>
    You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to
    the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free,
    for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
    writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
    WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including,
    without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-
    INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
  </li>
  <li>
    Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may
    submit it to Neocrym separately from any Contribution, identifying the
    complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction
    (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license
    agreements) of which you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the
    work as "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]".
  </li>
  <li>
    You agree to notify Neocrym of any facts or circumstances of which you
    become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any
    respect.
  </li>
</ol>
