  bound to the terms of Neocrym's Privacy Policy.

<p>
  Neocrym does not have a currently-active bug bounty for security issues. We
  currently do not guarantee payment for independent researchers that discover
  issues before contacting us first.
</p>
<p>
  Some infrastructure that we rely upon actually belongs to our vendors. In such
  cases, you would be bound by their security policies in addition to ours.
  Please contact us if you have any confusion about this matter.
</p>
<p>
  We do not permit you to run automated security scanners or tools that harm the
  quality or availability of the services that Neocrym offers. If you would like
  to use such tools against our infrastructure, please contact us first.
</p>
<p>
  If you are interested in doing security work for Neocrym, feel free to contact
  us beforehand.
